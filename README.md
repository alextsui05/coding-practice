# coding-practice

This is the `gh-pages` branch of the __coding-practice__ repository, where I write up explanations and notes to my solutions to programming problems. You can view the writeups at [http://alextsui05.github.io/coding-practice](http://alextsui05.github.io/coding-practice).

I am using [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com) to manage the writeups. It is basically a self-contained wiki in a file that you can edit locally in the browser.
